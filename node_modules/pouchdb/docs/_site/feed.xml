        <title>We have a problem with promises</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Fellow JavaScripters, it&amp;#39;s time to admit it: we have a problem with promises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PouchDB 3.5.0&amp;#58; Vote for PouchDB</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you support better documentation for PouchDB users? Do you value faster CORS and better Service Worker support? If so, then today you should cast your vote in support of PouchDB. Together, we can make a better future (release of PouchDB).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PouchDB 3.4.0&amp;#58; Better late than never</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a break, and for March PouchDB relaxed and enjoyed the arrival of spring. However, regularly scheduled programming has resumed, and today I am happy to announce PouchDB 3.4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Filtered replication&amp;#58; from Couch to Pouch and back</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Giovanni Ornaghi</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Filtered replication can become a vital feature for many applications, when you realize you don&amp;#39;t need the whole dataset to be replicated to each client. At the same time, filtered replication can be the wrong solution to your problem if:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taming the asynchronous beast with ES7</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Nolan Lawson</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the trickiest aspects of PouchDB is that its API is asynchronous. I see no shortage of confused questions on Stack Overflow, Github, and IRC, and most often they stem from a misunderstanding of callbacks and promises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Efficiently managing UI state with PouchDB</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Nolan Lawson</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A common pattern in data-driven apps is to display the entire database in the UI. If you&amp;#39;re using PouchDB, that means you want to mirror the contents of PouchDB to some in-memory representation used by the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick release, ahead of our normal monthly release schedule, to fix some critical bugs and ship them out sooner to our eager PouchDB fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;

          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A new month means a new PouchDB release. Over the last month we have been looking around the rough edges and cleaning things up or chopping them off along with the usual slew of bugfixes and a lot of great news.&lt;/p&gt;

          <dc:creator>Nolan Lawson</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A humble release to ring in the new year, PouchDB 3.2.1 is focused on bugfixes and performance improvements. In particular, 3.2.1 boasts some critical fixes for IE11 and node-webkit, as well as a fix for replication of conflicted documents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pains Of Being Async At Heart</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are testing JavaScript you will likely have to test against async API&amp;#39;s. These bring up some issues that you may not be familiar with if you are used to testing synchronous code. Here are a few things I have learnt working on the PouchDB test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
